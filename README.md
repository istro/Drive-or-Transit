DBC week 5 project
==================

This command-line app suggests how much faster it would take to make a trip by car versus by public transportation.

It supports multiple users, and stores recent addresses for each user. When trip origin and destination are specified, it connects to Google api and gets directions between the two locations, by car and by public transit, and then compares the time.

Participants:

- Phil Aquilina
- Sherief Gharraph
- Matt Nguyen
- David McDonald
- Ivan Stroganov
